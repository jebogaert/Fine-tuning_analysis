This repository is related to the paper [Fine-Tuning is not (Always) Overfitting Artifacts](https://perso.uclouvain.be/fstandae/PUBLIS/303.pdf)

To run the code, launch the notebook "Code esann.ipynb". The structure of the code is the same as the one of the paper. To change from one dataset to another : TODO
The available datasets are:
  1) Allocine - Movie review classification (https://huggingface.co/datasets/allocine)
  2) InfOpinion - Opinion classification (InfOpinion_dataset.csv)

The InfOpinion dataset was built based on the RTBF dataset presented in [The RTBF Corpus: a dataset of 750,000 Belgian French news articles published between 2008 and 2021](https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:276580) and available [here](https://dataverse.uclouvain.be/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.14428/DVN/PEVSSI). It was preprocessed using the method presented in [TIPECS : A corpus cleaning method using machine learning and qualitative analysis](https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:276581).
